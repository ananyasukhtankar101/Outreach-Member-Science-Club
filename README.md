# Outreach-Member : Science-Club
NMIMS Science Club Official Details : Most of the times, our classroom teaching does not provide  opportunity for self-expression, constructive activities and  independent analysis. Science Club is the platform to all UG, PG  and Ph.D. students across all departments of SDSOS to realize their  scientific skills and promote research interest.
The club aims to organize following events to inculcate studentâ€™s  knowledge and scientific attitude:
- Popular Science talks by eminent scientists
- Workshops, Exhibition, Symposia and Competitions
- Arranging visit to places of scientific interest
